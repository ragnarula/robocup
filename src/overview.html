<p>
Our solution for this coursework is a model-reflex agent designed around the concept of a one-way data flow.
Our model is re-created at every simulation step. The process begins with the server sending our ControllerPlayer
information via the info* methods. Once all the information is gathered into A Percept, a new model object is created.
This model object is passed sequentially through a chain of "AI Components" that implement the IChainable Interface via
the AbstractSimpleAIComponent abstract class.
<p>
Each component is responsible for adding more information in to the model by using information contained in the percept.
This could be simple information such as the current play mode, or involved more complex calculations such as to determine
the agent's current location.
<p>
By the time the model has passed through all the components the model should contain enough information to determine
what set of actions need to be executed. Actions are executed in the final compoenet, the AgentAction component. Here
the state design pattern is used to organise the agent's behaviour.
<p>
The concept is illustrated in the diagram below.
